# revshell-generator

This python code creates a bash script called 'rev' listening for an incoming tcp connections with several interpreters:
- bash
- php
- netcat


## Usage:
```bash
# Example ip:
python3 revsh.py 10.0.0.x 4444

# This script is based on the revshell generator used by XCT in his CTF challenges.
# Since I could not find the source in his github repos, I wrote the above code instead.
```
